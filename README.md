# layout-landing-page-for-Inboundcycle
As part of a web layout exercise, I had to make a landing page that looked as much as possible as the following image:

<img src="Design/Landing Page.jpg" style="width:500px"></img>

My outcome was:
<img src="Design/My Result.png" style="width:500px"></img>


In addition, I had to make a popup appear when the form was submitted:
<img src="Design/My result-popup.png" style="width:500px"></img>
