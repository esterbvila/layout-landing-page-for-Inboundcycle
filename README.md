# layout-landing-page-for-Inboundcycle
As part of a web layout exercise, I had to build a landing page using html, css and js that looked as much as possible as the following image:

<img src="Design/Landing Page.jpg"></img>

My outcome was:
<img src="Design/My Result.png"></img>


In addition, I had to make a popup appear when the form was submitted, which I made using js:
<img src="Design/My result-popup.png"></img>
